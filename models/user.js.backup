// The "models" object is provided by the Mongoose library and stores all the registered models.

/* 
    If a model name "User" already exists in the "models" object, it assigns that existing model 
to the "User" variable.
    This prevents redefining the model and ensures that the existing model is reused.
*/ 
/* 
    If a model named "User" does not exists in the "models" object, the "model" function from Mongoose
is called to create a new model.
    The newly created model is then assigned to the "User" variable.
